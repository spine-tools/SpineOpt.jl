The flow on connection c is then the sum over all nodes of ptdf(n, c)*net_injection(c). The advantage of this method is that it introduces no additional variables into the problem and instead, introduces only one constraint for each connection whose flow we are interested in monitoring.\nlodf: Line outage distribution factors are a function of the network ptdfs and their derivation is also found here. lodf(c_contingency, c_monitored) represents the fraction of the pre-contingency flow on connection c_contingency that will flow on c_monitored if c_contingency is disconnected. Therefore, the post contingency flow on connection c_monitored is the pre_contingency flow plus lodf(c_contingency, c_monitored)\\*pre_contingency_flow(c_contingency)). Therefore, consideration of N contingencies on M monitored lines introduces N x M constraints into the model. Usually one wishes to contain this number and methods are given below to achieve this.\nDefining your network To identify the network for which ptdfs, lodfs and connection_flows will be calculated according to the ptdf method, one does the following:\nCreate node objects for each bus in the model.\nCreate connection objects representing each line of the network: For each connection specify the connection_reactance parameter and the connection_type parameter. Setting connection_type=connection_type_lossless_bidirectional simplifies the amount of data that needs to be specified for an eletrical network. See connection_type for more details   \nSet the connection__to_node and connection__from_node relationships to define the topology of each connection along with the connection_capacity parameter on one or both of these relationships.\nSet the connection_emergency_capacity parameter to define the post contingency rating if lodf-based N-1 security constraints are to be included\nCreate a commodity object and node__commodity relationships for all the nodes that comprise the electrical network for which PTDFs are to be calculated.\nSpecify the commodity_physics parameter for the commodity to :commodity_physics_ptdf if ptdf-based DC load flow is desired with no N-1 security constraints or to :commodity_physics_lodf if it is desired to include lodf-based N-1 security constraints\nTo identify the reference bus(node) specify the node_opf_type parameter for the appropriate node with the value node_opf_type_reference.\nControlling problem size\nThe lines to be monitored are specified by setting the connection_monitored property for each connection for which a flow constraint is to be generated\nThe contingencies to be considered are specified by setting the connection_contingency property for the appropriate connections. For N contingencies and M monitored lines, N x M constraints will be generated.\nIf the lodf(c_contingency, c_monitored) is very small, it means the outage of c_contingency has a small impact on the flow on c_monitoredand there is little point in including this constraint in the model. This can be achieved by setting the commodity_lodf_tolerance commodity parameter. Contingency / Monotired line combinations with lodfs below this value will be ignored, reducing the size of the model.\nIf ptdf(n, c) is very small, it means an injection at n has a small impact on the flow on c and there is little point in considering it. This can be achieved by setting the commodity_ptdf_threshold commodity parameter. Node / Monotired line combinations with ptdfs below this value will be ignored, reducing the number of coefficients in the model.\nTo more easily identify which connections are worth being monitored or which contingencies are worth being considered, you can add the contingency_is_binding output to any of your reports (via a report__output relationship). This will run the model without the security constraints, and instead write a parameter called contingency_is_binding to the output database for each pair of contingency and monitored connection. The value of the parameter will be a (possibly stochastic) time-series where a value of one will indicate that the corresponding security constraint is binding, and zero otherwise.","category":"page"},{"location":"advanced_concepts/pressure_driven_gas_transfer/#pressure-driven-gas-transfer","page":"Pressure driven gas transfer","title":"Pressure driven gas transfer","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"advanced_concepts/pressure_driven_gas_transfer/","page":"Pressure driven gas transfer","title":"Pressure driven gas transfer","text":"The generic formulation of SpineOpt is based on a trade based model.

Usually the direction of flow is not known a priory. To ensure that the flow through the gas pipeline is unidirectional, the parameter has_binary_gas_flow needs to be set to true.\nnode: Nodes with different characteristics are used for the representation of pressure driven gas transfer.\nFor each connection, there will be two nodes representing the start and end point of the pipeline. Associated with these nodes are the following parameters: the has_pressure parameter, which needs to be set to true, in order to create the variable node_pressure; the max_node_pressure and min_node_pressure to constrain the pressure variable.\nTo leverage linepack flexibility, a third node is introduced representing the linepack storage of the pipeline. To trigger the storage linepack and hence, node_state variables, the has_state parameter needs to be set to true.\nconnection__to_node and connection__from_node To enable flows through the pipeline and into the linepack storage, each node has to have both these relationships in common with the connection pipeline. These relationships will trigger the generation of connection_flow variables in all possible directions.\nconnection__node__node This relationship is key to the pressure driven gas transfer, holding the information about the pipeline characteristics and bringing the elements into interaction.\nThe parameter connection_linepack_constant holds the linepack constant and triggers the generation of the line pack storage constraint. Note that the first node should be the linepack storage node, while the second node should be a node_group of both, the start and the end node of the pipeline.\nThe linearization of the Weymouth equation through outer approximation relies on the use of fixed pressure points. For this purpose, the two parameters fixed_pressure_constant_1 and fixed_pressure_constant_0 hold the fixed pressure constants and trigger the generation of the constraint_fix_node_pressure_point. The constraint introduces the relationship between pressure and gas flows. Note, that the pressure constants should be entered in a way, that the first node represents the origin node, the second node the destination node. Each connection should have a connection__node__node to each combination of its start and end nodes (and associated parameters). (See Schwele - Coordination of Power and Natural Gas Systems: Convexification Approaches for Linepack Modeling)\nBy default, pipelines are considered to be passive. However, a compression station between two pipeline pressure nodes can be represented by defining a compression_factor. The relationship should be defined in such a manner, that the first node represents the sending node, the second node represents the receiving node, which pressure is equal or smaller to the pressure at the sending node times the compression factor.\nLastly, to ensure the balance between incoming/outgoing flows and flows into the linepack, the ratio between the flows need to be fixed. The average incoming flows of the node group (of the pressure start and end nodes) have to equal the flows into the linepack storage, and vice versa. Therefore, the fix_ratio_out_in_connection_flow needs to be set to a value (typically 1) for the (pressure group, linepack storage) node pair, and for the (linepack storage, pressure group) node pair.","category":"page"},{"location":"advanced_concepts/pressure_driven_gas_transfer/","page":"Pressure driven gas transfer","title":"Pressure driven gas transfer","text":"A gas pipeline and its connected nodes are illustrated below.

The heat rate segment MW operating points are defined by operating_points.","category":"page"},{"location":"concept_reference/unit_incremental_heat_rate/","page":"-","title":"-","text":"To implement a simple incremental heat rate function,unit_incremental_heat_rate should be given as a simple scalar representing the incremental heat rate over the entire operating range of the unit. To implement a piecewise linear heat rate function, unit_incremental_heat_rate should be specified as an array type. It is then used in conjunction with the unit parameter operating_points which should also be defined as an array type of equal dimension. When defined as an array type unit_incremental_heat_rate[i] is the effective incremental heat rate between operating_points [i-1] (or zero if i=1) and operating_points[i]. Note that operating_points is defined on a capacity-normalized basis so if operating_points is specified as [0.5, 1], this creates two operating segments, one from zero to 50% of the corresponding unit_capacity and a second from 50% to 100% of the corresponding unit_capacity.","category":"page"},{"location":"advanced_concepts/Lossless_DC_power_flow/#Lossless-nodal-DC-power-flows","page":"Lossless nodal DC power flows","title":"Lossless nodal DC power flows","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"advanced_concepts/Lossless_DC_power_flow/","page":"Lossless nodal DC power flows","title":"Lossless nodal DC power flows","text":"Currently, there are two different methods to represent lossless DC power flows.

To use voltage angles for the representation of a lossless DC model, the has_voltage_angle needs to be true for these nodes (which will trigger the generation of the node_voltage_angle variable). Limits on the voltage angle can be enforced through the max_voltage_angle and min_voltage_angle parameters. The reference node of the system should have a voltage angle equal to zero, assigned through the parameter fix_node_voltage_angle.\nconnection__to_node and connection__from_node : These relationships need to be introduced between the connection and each node, in order to allow power flows (i.e. connection_flow).
