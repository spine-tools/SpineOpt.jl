add_constraint_node_voltages_conic!(m::Model)

Binds the different voltage products together with a second order conic constraint. This is a
relaxation of the original constraint which is an equality constraint.

N.B. This is a second order conic constraint (=nonlinear) and thus unfit for any linear solver.
