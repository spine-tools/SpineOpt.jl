[units\_invested](@ref) represents the point-in-time decision to invest in a unit or not,
while [units\_invested\_available](@ref) represents the invested-in units that are available at a specific time.
This constraint enforces the relationship between [units\_invested](@ref), [units\_invested\_available](@ref)
and [units\_mothballed](@ref) in adjacent timeslices.

```math
\begin{aligned}
& v^{units\_invested\_available}_{(u,s,t)} - v^{units\_invested}_{(u,s,t)}
+ v^{units\_monthballed}_{(u,s,t)}
= v^{units\_invested\_available}_{(u,s,t-1)} \\
& \forall u \in unit: p^{candidate\_units}_{(u)} \neq 0 \\
& \forall (s,t)
\end{aligned}

Keyword arguments can be used to filter the resulting array.
