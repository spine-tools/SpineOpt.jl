@doc raw"""
Constrain [connections\_invested\_available](@ref) by the investment lifetime of a connection.
The parameter [connection\_investment\_lifetime\_sense](@ref) defaults to minimum investment 
lifetime ([connection\_investment\_lifetime\_sense](@ref) [`>=`](@ref constraint_sense_list)),
but can be changed to strict lifetime ([connection\_investment\_lifetime\_sense](@ref) [`==`](@ref constraint_sense_list))
or maximum investment lifetime ([connection\_investment\_lifetime\_sense](@ref) [`<=`](@ref constraint_sense_list)).
The connection lifetime is enforced by the following constraint:

```math
\begin{aligned}
& v^{connections\_invested\_available}_{(conn,s,t)}
- \sum_{
        t\_past = t-p^{connection\_investment\_tech\_lifetime}
}^{t}
v^{connections\_invested}_{(conn,s,t\_past)} \\
& \begin{cases}
\ge & \text{if } p^{connection\_investment\_lifetime\_sense} = ">=" \\
= & \text{if } p^{connection\_investment\_lifetime\_sense} = "==" \\
\le & \text{if } p^{connection\_investment\_lifetime\_sense} = "<=" \\
\end{cases} \\
& 0 \\
& \forall (conn,s,t)
\end{aligned}
```
