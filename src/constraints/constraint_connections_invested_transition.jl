[connections\_invested](@ref) represents the point-in-time decision to invest in a connection or not while
[connections\_invested\_available](@ref) represents the invested-in connections that are available at a specific time.
This constraint enforces the relationship between [connections\_invested](@ref), [connections\_invested\_available](@ref) and
[connections\_decommissioned](@ref) in adjacent timeslices.

& = v^{connections\_invested\_available}_{(c,s,t-1)} \\
& \forall c \in connection: p^{candidate\_connections}_{(c)} \neq 0 \\
