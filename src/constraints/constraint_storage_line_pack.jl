@doc raw"""
In order to account for linepack flexibility, i.e. storage capability of a connection, the linepack storage is linked
to the average pressure of the adjacent nodes by the following equation,
triggered by the parameter [connection\_linepack\_constant](@ref):

```math
\begin{aligned}
& v^{node\_state}_{(n_{stor},s,t)} = \left(
    p^{connection\_linepack\_constant}_{(conn,n_{stor},ng)} \middle/ 2
\right) \cdot \sum_{n \in ng} v^{node\_pressure}_{(n,s,t)} \\
& \forall (conn, n_{stor}, ng) \in indices(p^{connection\_linepack\_constant}) \\
& \forall (s,t)
\end{aligned}
```

!!! note
    The parameter [connection\_linepack\_constant](@ref) should be defined
    on a [connection\_\_node\_\_node](@ref)relationship, where the first node corresponds to the linepack storage node,
    whereas the second node corresponds to the node group of both start and end nodes of the pipeline.
