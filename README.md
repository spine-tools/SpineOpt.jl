### :loudspeaker: Community and how to ask help :rocket:

There are four main ways to get help with SpineOpt.

1. Monthly user meetings for Spine Toolbox and SpineOpt. There you can connect with other users, present problems and exchange experiences. New and old users equally welcome. The meetings are held first Tuesday of every month at 3pm CEST [:calendar: ics zip](https://github.com/spine-tools/SpineOpt.jl/blob/master/SpineTools_user_meeting.ics) and can be joined [here](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ZDBkZjBhNmEtMGFmZi00ZDllLWE4ZmQtMWJhMWZjYjUyNDUy%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%223973589b-9e40-4eb5-800e-b0b6383d1621%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%224c379655-31a5-4c3e-b6d6-b61817a44e14%22%7d). For meeting updates, please checkout [this discussion](https://github.com/spine-tools/SpineOpt.jl/discussions/849).
2. [Gitter](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#spine-tools_community:gitter.im) (i.e. Matrix) chat service. You need to register but allows to ask quick questions and hopefullly get quick answers.
3. [Discussion forum](https://github.com/spine-tools/SpineOpt.jl/discussions/categories/support) (support section) can be used when you don't know how to get something done or you don't quite know why something isn't working. It's highly appreciated if other users can contribute by helping each other (developers are short on time).
4. [Issue tracker](https://github.com/spine-tools/SpineOpt.jl/issues) should be used only when there is a missing feature or something should work but it's not working. Update your tools and test with latest software before submitting an issue. In case of new feature, make sure there is no existing issue. Issues reporting bugs should provide sufficient information to enable locating and fixing the bug.

### Getting started

We highly recommend you to go through the [getting started](https://spine-tools.github.io/SpineOpt.jl/latest/getting_started/) chapter of the documentation.

The chapter explains in great detail the different ways to [install](https://spine-tools.github.io/SpineOpt.jl/latest/getting_started/installation/) SpineOpt. The prerequisites are also mentioned here.

The chapter also explains how to set up a minimal [workflow](https://spine-tools.github.io/SpineOpt.jl/latest/getting_started/recommended_workflow/) to test your installation. This part also includes some explanations on what you see during the setup so you can already get a bit familiar with using SpineOpt.

If any issues arise during the first two steps, you can consult the [trouble shooting](https://spine-tools.github.io/SpineOpt.jl/latest/getting_started/troubleshooting/) section.

The documentation also contains tutorials on the different features of SpineOpt (the underlying files of the tutorials are part of our tests so these should always be up to date, though the text/images may lag behind some times).
