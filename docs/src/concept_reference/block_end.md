Indicates the end of this temporal block. The default value is equal to a duration of 0. It is useful to distinguish here between two cases: a single solve, or a rolling window optimization.

**single solve**
When a Date time value is chosen, this is directly the end of the optimization for this temporal block. In a single solve optimization, a combination of [block\_start](@ref) and [block_end](@ref) can easily be used to run optimizations that cover only part of the model horizon. Multiple [temporal_block](@ref) objects can then be used to create optimizations for disconnected time periods, which is commonly used in the method of representative days. The default value coincides with the [model_end](@ref).

**rolling window optimization**
To create a temporal block that is rolling along with the optimization window, a rolling temporal block, a duration value should be chosen. The [block\_end](@ref) parameter will in this case determine the size of the optimization window, with respect to the start of each optimization window. If multiple temporal blocks with different [block\_end](@ref) parameters exist, the maximum value will determine the size of the optimization window. Note, this is different from the [roll_forward](@ref) parameter, which determines how much the window moves for after each optimization. For more info, see [One single `temporal_block`](@ref). The default value is equal to the [roll\_forward](@ref) parameter.
