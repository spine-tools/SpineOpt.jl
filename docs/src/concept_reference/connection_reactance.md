The per unit reactance of a transmission line. Used in ptdf based dc load flow where the relative reactances of lines determine the ptdfs of the network and in lossless dc powerflow where the flow on a line is given by `flow = 1/x(theta_to-theta_from)` where x is the reatance of the line, theta_to is the voltage angle of the remote node and theta_from is the voltage angle of the sending node.
