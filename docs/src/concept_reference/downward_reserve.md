If a [node](@ref) has a `true` [is\_reserve\_node](@ref) parameter,
it will be treated as a reserve node in the model. To define whether
the node corresponds to an upward or downward reserve commodity, the [upward\_reserve](@ref) or the [downward\_reserve](@ref)
parameter needs to be set to true, respectively.
