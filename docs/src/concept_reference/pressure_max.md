If a node has a [node\_pressure](@ref) variable (see also the parameter [has\_pressure](@ref) and this [chapter](@ref pressure-driven-gas-transfer)),
an upper bound on the pressure can be introduced through the [pressure\_max](@ref) parameter, which triggers the generation of the [maxmimum node pressure](@ref constraint_max_node_pressure) constraint.
