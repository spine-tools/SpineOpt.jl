If a node is to represent a node in a pressure driven gas network, the boolean parameter
[has\_pressure](@ref) should be set true, in order to trigger the generation of the
[node\_pressure](@ref) variable.
The pressure at a certain node can also be constrainted through the
parameters [pressure\_max](@ref) and [min\_node\_pressure](@ref). More details on the use of pressure driven gas transfer
are described [here](@ref pressure-driven-gas-transfer)
