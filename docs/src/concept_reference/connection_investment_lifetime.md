[connection\_investment\_lifetime](@ref) is the minimum amount of time that a [connection](@ref) has
to stay in operation once it's invested-in. Only after that time, the [connection](@ref)
can be decomissioned. Note that `connection_investment_tech_lifetime` is a dynamic parameter that will impact the amount of solution history that must remain available to the optimisation in each step - this may impact performance.
