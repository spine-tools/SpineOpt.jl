Commodities correspond to the type of energy traded. When associated with a [node](@ref) through the [node\_\_commodity](@ref) relationship, a specific form of energy, i.e. commodity, can be associated with a specific location. Furthermore, by linking commodities with [unit](@ref)s, it is possible to track the flows of a certain commodity and impose limitations on the use of a certain commodity (See also [max\_cum\_in\_unit\_flow\_bound](@ref)).
For the representation of specific commodity physics, related to e.g. the representation of the electric network, designated parameters can be defined to enforce commodity specific behaviour. (See also [commodity\_physics](@ref))
