If [operating\_points](@ref) is defined on a certain `unit__to_node` or `unit__from_node` flow, the corresponding `unit_flow` flow variable is decomposed into a number of sub-variables, `unit_flow_op` one for each operating point, with an additional index, `i` to reference the specific operating point. `fix_unit_flow_op` can thus be used to fix the value of one or more of the variables as desired.
