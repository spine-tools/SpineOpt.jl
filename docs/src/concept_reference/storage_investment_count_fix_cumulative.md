The `storage_investment_count_fix_cumulative` parameter is used  primarily to fix the value of the
`storages_invested_available` variable which represents the storages investment decision variable and how many candidate
storages are available at the corresponding node, time step and stochastic scenario. Used also in the decomposition
framework to communicate the value of the master problem solution variables to the operational sub-problem.
