If a [node](@ref) has a `true` [reserve\_active](@ref) parameter,
it will be treated as a reserve node in the model. To define whether
the node corresponds to an upward or downward reserve commodity, the [reserve\_upward](@ref) or the [reserve\_downward](@ref)
parameter needs to be set to `true`, respectively.
