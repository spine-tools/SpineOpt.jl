This determines the optimality convergence criterion and is the benders gap tolerance for the master problem in a decomposed investments model. The benders gap is the relative difference between the current objective function upper bound(z_upper) and lower bound (z_lower) and is defined as 2*(z_upper-z_lower)/(z_upper + z_lower). When this value is lower than `decomposition_max_gap` the benders algorithm will terminate having achieved satisfactory optimality.
