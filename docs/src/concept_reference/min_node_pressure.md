If a node has a [node\_pressure](@ref) variable (see also the parameter [has\_pressure](@ref) and this [chapter](@ref pressure-driven-gas-transfer)),
a lower bound on the pressure can be introduced through the [min\_node\_pressure](@ref) parameter, which triggers the generation of the [minimum node pressure](@ref constraint_min_node_pressure) constraint.
