Grids are for trading different types of commodities. When associated with a [node](@ref) through the [node\_\_grid](@ref) relationship, a specific location can be associated with a specific grid (or form of commodity). Furthermore, by linking grids with [unit](@ref)s, it is possible to track the flows of a certain type of commodity and impose limitations on the use of a certain form of commodity (See also [max\_cum\_in\_unit\_flow\_bound](@ref)).
For the representation of specific grid physics, related to e.g. the representation of the electric network, designated parameters can be defined to enforce grid specific behaviour. (See also [physics\_type](@ref))
