Grids are for trading different types of commodities. When associated with a [node](@ref) through the [node\_\_grid](@ref) relationship, a specific location can be associated with a specific grid (or form of commodity). 
For the representation of specific grid physics, related to e.g. the representation of the electric network, designated parameters can be defined to enforce grid specific behaviour. (See also [physics\_type](@ref))
