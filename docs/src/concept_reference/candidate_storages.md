Within an investments problem `candidate_storages` determines the upper bound on the storages investment decision variable in constraint `storages_invested_available`. In constraint `node_state_cap` the maximum node state will be the product of the storages investment variable and [node\_state\_cap](@ref). Thus, the interpretation of `candidate_storages` depends on [storage\_investment\_variable\_type](@ref) which determines the investment decision variable type. If [storage\_investment\_variable\_type](@ref) is integer or binary, then `candidate_storages` represents the maximum number of discrete storages of size [node\_state\_cap](@ref) that may be invested in at the corresponding node. If [storage\_investment\_variable\_type](@ref) is continuous, `candidate_storages` is more analagous to a maximum storage capacity with `node_state_cap` being analagous to a scaling parameter.

Note that `candidate_storages` is the main investment switch and setting a value other than none/nothing triggers the creation of the investment variable for storages at the corresponding node. Note that a value of zero will still trigger the variable creation but its value will be fixed to zero. This can be useful if an inspection of the related dual variables will yield the value of this resource.
