The [coefficient\_for\_units\_invested](@ref) is an optional parameter that can be used to include the [units\_invested](@ref) variable in a [user\_constraint](@ref) via the [unit\_\_user\_constraint](@ref) relationship.
Essentially, [coefficient\_for\_units\_invested](@ref) appears as a coefficient for the
[units\_invested](@ref) variable in the [user constraint](@ref constraint_user_constraint). For more information, see the [User Constraints Concept Reference][#User-Constraints]
