The [storages\_invested\_big\_m\_mga](@ref) parameter is used in combination with the MGA algorithm (see [mga-advanced](@ref)).
It defines an upper bound on the maximum difference between any MGA iteration. The big M should be chosen always sufficiently large. (Typically, a value equivalent to
[candidate\_storages](@ref) could suffice.)
