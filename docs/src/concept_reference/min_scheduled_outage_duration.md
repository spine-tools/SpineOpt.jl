The definition of the `min_scheduled_outage_duration` duration parameter will trigger the creation of the [Constraint on minimum up time](@ref constraint_min_scheduled_outage_duration). It sets a lower bound on the sum of the [units\_out\_of\_service](@ref) variable over the optimisation window. The primary function of this parameter is thus, to schedule maintenance outages for units. This parameter enforces that the unit must be taken out of service for at least an amount of time equal to `min_scheduled_outage_duration`

It can be defined for a [unit](@ref) and will then impose restrictions on the [units\_out\of\_service](@ref) variables that represent whether a unit is on maintenance ourage at that particular time. The parameter is given as a duration value. When the parameter is not included, the aforementioned constraint will not be created, which is equivalent to choosing a value of 0.

To scheduled maintenance outages using this functionality, one must activate the [units\_out\of\_service](@ref) variable. This is done by changing the value of the [outage\_variable\_type](@ref) to either `online_variable_type_integer` (for clustered units) or `online_variable_type_binary` for binary units or `unit_online_variable_type_linear` for continuous units. Setting [outage\_variable\_type](@ref) to `online_variable_type_none` will deactivate the [units\_out\of\_service](@ref) variable and this is the default value.
