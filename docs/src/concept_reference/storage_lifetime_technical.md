Duration parameter that determines the minimum duration of storage investment decisions. Once a storage has been invested-in, it must remain invested-in for `storage_lifetime_technical`. Note that `storage_lifetime_technical` is a dynamic parameter that will impact the amount of solution history that must remain available to the optimisation in each step - this may impact performance.
