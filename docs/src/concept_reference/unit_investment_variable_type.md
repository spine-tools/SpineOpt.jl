Within an investments problem `unit_investment_variable_type` determines the [unit](@ref) investment decision variable type. Since the `unit_flow`s will be limited to the product of the investment variable and the corresponding [unit\_capacity](@ref) for each `unit_flow` and since [candidate\_units](@ref) represents the upper bound of the investment decision variable, `unit_investment_variable_type` thus determines what the investment decision represents. If [unit\_investment\_variable\_type](@ref) is integer or binary, then [candidate\_units](@ref) represents the maximum number of discrete units that may be invested. If [unit\_investment\_variable\_type](@ref) is continuous, `candidate_units` is more analagous to a capacity with [unit\_capacity](@ref) being analagous to a scaling parameter. For example, if `unit_investment_variable_type` = `integer`, `candidate_units` = 4 and `unit_capacity` for a particular `unit_flow` = 400 MW, then the investment decision is how many 400 MW units to build. If `unit_investment_variable_type` = continuous, `candidate_units` = 400 and `unit_capacity` for a particular `unit_flow` = 1 MW, then the investment decision is how much capacity if this particular unit to build. Finally, if `unit_investment_variable_type` = `integer`, `candidate_units` = 10 and `unit_capacity` for a particular `unit_flow` = 50 MW, then the investment decision is many 50MW blocks of capacity of this particular unit to build.
