Duration parameter that determines the minimum duration of `unit` investment decisions. Once a `unit` has been invested-in, it must remain invested-in for `unit_investment_tech_lifetime`. Note that `unit_investment_tech_lifetime` is a dynamic parameter that will impact the amount of solution history that must remain available to the optimisation in each step - this may impact performance.
