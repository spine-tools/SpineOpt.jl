The [storage\_state\_min](@ref) parameter sets the lower bound for the [node\_state](@ref) variable,
if one has been enabled by the [storage\_activate](@ref) parameter.
For reserve [node](@ref)s with [minimum\_reserve\_activation\_time](@ref),
the [storage\_state\_min](@ref) is considered also via a special constraint.
