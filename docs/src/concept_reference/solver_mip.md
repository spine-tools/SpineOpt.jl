Specifies the Julia solver package to be used to solve Mixed Integer Programming Problems (MIPs) for the specific [model](@ref). 
The value must correspond exactly (case sensitive) to the name of the Julia solver package (e.g. `Cbc.jl`). Installation and configuration of
solvers is the responsibility of the user. A full list of solvers supported by JuMP can be found [here](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/installation/#Supported-solvers). 
Note that the specified problem must support MIP problems. Solver options are specified using the [solver\_mip\_options](@ref) parameter for the model.
Note also that if `run_spineopt()` is called with the mip_solver keyword argument specified, this will override this parameter.
