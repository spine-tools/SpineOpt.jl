The `fix_units_on` parameter simply fixes the value of the [units\_on](@ref) variable to the provided value. As such, it determines directly how many members of the specific [unit](@ref) will be online throughout the model when a single value is selected. It is also possible to provide a timeseries of values, which can be used for example to impose initial conditions by providing a value only for the first timestep included in the model.
