If `operating_points` is defined as an array type on a certain `unit__to_node` or `unit__from_node` flow, the corresponding `unit_flow` flow variable is decomposed into a number of sub operating segment variables, `unit_flow_op` one for each operating segment, with an additional index, `i` to reference the specific operating segment. Each value in the array represents the upper bound of the operating segment, normalized on `unit_capacity` for the corresponding `unit__to_node` or `unit__from_node` flow. `operating_points` is used in conjunction with [fix\_ratio\_in\_out\_unit\_flow](@ref) where the array dimension must match and is used to define the normalized operating point bounds for the corresponding incremental ratio. `operating_points` is also used in conjunction with [user\_constraint](@ref) where the array dimension must match any corresponding piecewise linear [unit\_flow\_coefficient](@ref). Here `operating_points` is used also to define the normalized operating point bounds for the corresponding [unit\_flow\_coefficient](@ref)s.

Note that `operating_points` is defined on a capacity-normalized basis and the values represent the upper bound of the corresponding operating segment variable. So if `operating_points` is specified as [0.5, 1], this creates two operating segments, one from zero to 50% of the corresponding [unit\_capacity](@ref) and a second from 50% to 100% of the corresponding [unit\_capacity](@ref).
