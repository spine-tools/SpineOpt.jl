Within an investments problem `storage_investment_variable_type` determines the storage investment decision variable type. Since a [node](@ref)'s `node_state` will be limited to the product of the investment variable and the corresponding [node\_state\_cap](@ref) and since [candidate\_storages](@ref) represents the upper bound of the storage investment decision variable, `storage_investment_variable_type` thus determines what the investment decision represents. If [storage\_investment\_variable\_type](@ref) is integer or binary, then [candidate\_storages](@ref) represents the maximum number of discrete storages that may be invested-in. If [storage\_investment\_variable\_type](@ref) is continuous, `candidate_storages` is more analagous to a capacity with [node\_state\_cap](@ref) being analagous to a scaling parameter. For example, if `storage_investment_variable_type` = `integer`, `candidate_storages` = 4 and `node_state_cap` = 1000 MWh, then the investment decision is how many 1000h MW storages to build. If `storage_investment_variable_type` = continuous, `candidate_storages` = 1000 and `node_state_cap` = 1 MWh, then the investment decision is how much storage capacity to build. Finally, if `storage_investment_variable_type` = `integer`, `candidate_storages` = 10 and `node_state_cap` = 100 MWh, then the investment decision is how many 100MWh storage blocks to build.
