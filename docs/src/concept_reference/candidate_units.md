Within an investments problem `candidate_units` determines the upper bound on the [unit](@ref) investment decision variable in constraint `units_invested_available`. In constraint `unit_flow_capacity` the maximum `unit_flow` will be the product of the `units_invested_available` and the corresponding [unit\_capacity](@ref). Thus, the interpretation of `candidate_units` depends on [unit\_investment\_variable\_type](@ref) which determines the [unit](@ref) investment decision variable type. If [unit\_investment\_variable\_type](@ref) is integer or binary, then `candidate_units` represents the maximum number of discrete units that may be invested in. If [unit\_investment\_variable\_type](@ref) is continuous, `candidate_units` is more analagous to a maximum storage capacity.

Note that `candidate_units` is the main investment switch and setting a value other than none/nothing triggers the creation of the investment variable for the [unit](@ref). Note that a value of zero will still trigger the variable creation but its value will be fixed to zero. This can be useful if an inspection of the related dual variables will yield the value of this resource.
