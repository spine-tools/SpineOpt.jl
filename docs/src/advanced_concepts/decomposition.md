# Decomposition

Decomposition approaches take advantage of certain problem structures to separate them into multiple related problems which are each more easily solved. Decomposition also allows us to do the inverse, which is to combine independent problems into a single problem, where each can be solved separately but with communication between them (e.g. investments and operations problems)

Decomposition thus allows us to do a number of things

  - Solve larger problems which are otherwise intractable
  - Include more detail in problems which otherwise need to be simplified
  - Combine related problems (e.g. investments/operations) in a more scientific way (rather than ad-hoc).
  - Employ parallel computing methods to solve multiple problems simultaneously.

## High-level Decomposition Algorithm
The high-level algorithm is described below. For a more detailed description please see [Benders decomposition](@ref benders_decomposition)

 - Model initialisation (preprocess_data_structure, generate temporal structures etc.)
 - For each benders_iteration
   - Solve master problem
   - Process master-problem solution:
     - set `units_invested_bi(unit=u)` equal to the investment variables solution from the master problem
   - Solve operations problem loop
   - Process operations sub-problem
     - set `units_on_mv(unit=u)` equal to the marginal value of the units_on bound constraint
   - Test for convergence
   - Update master problem
     - Add [Benders cuts constraints](@ref constraint_mp_any_invested_cuts)
   - Rewind operations problem
   - Next benders iteration

## Duals and reduced costs calculation for decomposition
The marginal values above are computed as the reduced costs of relevant optimisation variables. However, the dual solution to a MIP problem is not well defined. The standard approach to obtaining marginal values from a MIP model is to relax the integer variables, fix them to their last solution value and re-solve the problem as an LP. This is the standard approach in energy system modelling to obtain energy prices. However, although this is the standard approach, it does need to be used with caution. The main hazard associated with inferring duals in this way is that the impact on costs of an investment may be overstated. However, since these duals are used in Benders decomposition to obtain a lower bound on costs (i.e. the maximum potential value from an investment), this is ok and can be "corrected" in the next iteration. And finally, the benders gap will tell us how close our decomposed problem is to the optimal global solution.

## Reporting dual values and reduced costs
To report the dual of a constraint, one can add an output item with the corresponding constraint name (e.g. `constraint_nodal_balance`) and add that to a report. This will cause the corresponding constraint's relaxed problem marginal value will be reported in the output DB. When adding a constraint name as an output we need to preface the actual constraint name with `constraint_` to avoid ambiguity with variable names (e.g. `units_available`). So to report the marginal value of `units_available` we add an output object called `constraint_units_available`.

To report the reduced cost for a variable which is the marginal value of the associated active bound or fix constraints
on that variable, one can add an output object with the variable name prepended by `bound_`. So, to report the units_on reduced_cost value, one would create an output item called `bound_units_on`. If added to a report, this will cause the reduced cost of [units\_on](@ref) in the final fixed LP to be written to the output db.

## Using Decomposition
Assuming one has set up a conventional investments problem as described in [Investment Optimization](@ref) the following additional steps are required to utilise the decomposition framework:
  - Set the [model\_type](@ref) parameter for your `model` to `spineopt_benders`.
  - Specify [decomposition\_max\_gap](@ref) parameter for your `model` - This determines the master problem convergence criterion for the relative benders gap. A value of 0.05 will represent a relative benders gap of 5%.
  - Specify the [decomposition\_max\_iterations](@ref) parameter for your `model` - This determines the master problem convergence criterion for the number of iterations. A value of 10 could be appropriate but this is highly dependent on the size and nature of the problem.

Once the above is set, all investment decisions in the model are automatically decomposed and optimised in a Benders master problem. This behaviour may change in the future to allow some investment decisions to be optimised in the operations problem and some optimised in the master problem as desired.
