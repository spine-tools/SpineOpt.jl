## Imposing a limit on renewable production
## Limiting the cumulated flow of a unit group by an absolute value
In the current landscape of energy systems modeling, especially in investment models, it is a common idea to implement a lower limit on the amount of electricity that is generated by renewable sources. SpineOpt allows the user to implement such restrictions by means of the [min\_total\_cumulated\_unit\_flow\_to\_node](@ref) parameter. Which will trigger the creation of the [constraint\_total\_cumulated\_unit\_flow](@ref constraint_total_cumulated_unit_flow).

To impose  a limit on overall renewable generation over the entire optimization horizon, the following objects, relationships, and parameters are relevant:

1. **[unit](@ref)**: In this case, a unit represents a process (e.g. electricity generation from wind), where one
  or multiple [unit\_flow](@ref)s are associated with renewable generation
2. **[node](@ref)**: Besides from nodes required to denote e.g. a fuel node or a supply node, at least one node should be introduced representing
    electricity demand.
    (*Note: To distinguish e.g. between regions there can also be more than one electricity node*)
3. **[unit\_\_to\_node](@ref)**: To associate electricity flows with a unit, the relationship between the unit and the electricity node needs to be imposed,
    to trigger the generation of a electricity-[unit\_flow](@ref) variable.
4. **[max\_total\_cumulated\_unit\_flow\_to\_node](@ref)**: This parameter triggers a limit on all flows from a unit (or a group of units), e.g. the group of all renewable generators, to a node (or node group).

Let's take a look at a simple example to see how this works. Suppose that we have a system with only one node, which represents the demand for electricity, and two units: a wind farm, and a conventional gas unit. To connect the wind farm to the electricity node, the [unit\_\_to\_node](@ref) relationship has to be defined.

One can then simply define the [min\_total\_cumulated\_unit\_flow\_to\_node](@ref) parameter for the 'wind_farm__to_electricity_node' relationship to impose a lower bound on the total generation origination from the wind farm.

Note that the value of this parameter is expected to be given as an absolute value, thus care has to be taken to make sure that the units match with the ones used for the [unit\_flow](@ref) variable.

The main source of flexibility in the use of this constraint lies in the possibility to define the parameter for relationships that link 'node_groups' and/or 'unit_groups'. For example, by grouping multiple units that are considered renewable sources (e.g. PV, and wind), targets can be implemented across multiple renewable sources. Similarly, by defining multiple electricity nodes, generation targets can be spatially disagreggated.

## Imposing a limit on carbon
To impose a limit on overall carbon emissions over the entire optimization horizon,
the following objects, relationships and parameters are relevant:

1. **[unit](@ref)**: In this case, a unit represents a process (e.g. conversion of Gas to Electricity), where one
  or multiple [unit\_flow](@ref)s are associated with carbon emissions
2. **[node](@ref)**: Besides from nodes required to denote e.g. a fuel node or a supply node, at least one node should be introduced representing
    carbon emissions.
    (*Note: To distinguish e.g. between regions there can also be more than one carbon node*)
3. **[unit\_\_to\_node](@ref)**: To associate carbon flows with a unit, the relationship between the unit and the carbon node needs to be imposed,
    to trigger the generation of a carbon-[unit\_flow](@ref) variable.
4. **[unit\_\_node\_\_node](@ref)** and **[fix\_ratio\_out\_out](@ref) **: Ratio between e.g. output and output unit flows; e.g. how carbon intensive an electricity flow of a unit is. The parameter is defined on a [unit\_\_node\_\_node](@ref) relationship, for example (gasplant, Carbon, Electricity). (*Note: For a full list of possible ratios, see also [unit\_\_node\_\_node](@ref) and associated parameters*)
5. **[max\_total\_cumulated\_unit\_flow\_to\_node](@ref)** (and **[unit\_\_to\_node](@ref)**): This parameter triggers a limit on all flows from a unit (or a group of units), e.g. the group of all conventional generators, to a node (or node groups), e.g. considering the atmosphere as a fictive CO2 node, over the entire modelling horizon (e.g. a carbon budget). For example this could be defined on a relationship between a gasplant and a Carbon node, but can also be defined a unit group of all conventional generators and a carbon node.

## Imposing a carbon taxes
To include carbon pricing in a model,
the following objects, relationships and parameters are relevant:

1. **[unit](@ref)**: In this case, a unit represents a process (e.g. conversion of Gas to Electricity), where one
  or multiple [unit\_flow](@ref)s are associated with carbon emissions
2. **[node](@ref)** and **[tax\_in\_unit\_flow](@ref)**: Besides from nodes required to denote e.g. a fuel node or a supply node, at least one node should be introduced representing carbon emissions. To associate a carbon-tax with all incoming [unit\_flow](@ref)s, the [tax\_in\_unit\_flow](@ref) parameter can be defined on this node
    (*Note: To distinguish e.g. between regions there can also be more than one carbon node*)
3. **[unit\_\_to\_node](@ref)**: To associate carbon flows with a unit, the relationship between the unit and the carbon node needs to be imposed,
    to trigger the generation of a carbon-[unit\_flow](@ref) variable.
4. **[unit\_\_node\_\_node](@ref)** and **[fix\_ratio\_out\_out](@ref) **: Ratio between e.g. output and output unit flows; e.g. how carbon intensive an electricity flow of a unit is. The parameter is defined on a [unit\_\_node\_\_node](@ref) relationship, for example (Gasplant, Carbon, Electricity). (*Note: For a full list of possible ratios, see also [unit\_\_node\_\_node](@ref) and associated parameters*)
