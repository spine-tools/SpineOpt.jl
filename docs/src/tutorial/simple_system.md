# Simple System tutorial

Welcome to Spine Toolbox's Simple System tutorial.

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to setup a simple energy
system with Spine Toolbox for SpineOpt.
Spine Toolbox is used to create a workflow with databases and tools and 
SpineOpt is the tool that simulates/optimizes the energy system.

## Introduction

### Model assumptions

-   Two power plants take fuel from a source node and release
    electricity to another node in order to supply a demand.
-   Power plant 'a' has a capacity of 100 MWh, a variable operating cost
    of 25 euro/fuel unit, and generates 0.7 MWh of electricity per unit
    of fuel.
-   Power plant 'b' has a capacity of 200 MWh, a variable operating cost
    of 50 euro/fuel unit, and generates 0.8 MWh of electricity per unit
    of fuel.
-   The demand at the electricity node is 150 MWh.
-   The fuel node is able to provide infinite energy.

## Guide

### Spine Toolbox workflow

The workflow for this tutorial is quite simple: A SpineOpt tool that 
reads data from an input database, executes the simulation/optimization 
and writes the results to an output database.

To create the workflow, it is almost as simple as dragging these items
(i.e. Data Store and Run SpineOpt) to the *Design View* and
connecting them by dragging arrows between the blocks 
but there are some things that need to be configured:
-   The databases need to be initialised. Once you select a database
    you see the properties panel. Select the dialect of the database.
    Here we choose sqlite. Then press the button 'new spine db' to 
    create and save the database on your computer 
    (Spine Toolbox will suggest a good folder).

-   Connecting tools with (yellow) arrows in the Toolbox does not mean that 
    the tools will use these items.
    The arrows in the Toolbox view make items (databases) available.
    To let SpineOpt know we want to use these items, we need to go to the 
    properties panel of Run SpineOpt and drag the available items to the 
    tool arguments. The order of the items is first the input, then the output.
    See below for how the property window should look.

-   (optional) The Spine data stores are quite generic. In order for SpineOpt to be able 
    to read the input database, we need to change its format from the Spine format 
    to the SpineOpt format. Luckily we can use templates for this. One of those 
    templates is made available as an item in Spine Toolbox: Load template. 
    The other option is to load templates into the database using the db editor. 
    The templates can also be used to pre-populate the database with some basic 
    components. Here we briefly explain the use of the Load template 
    block and later we show how to import a template and basic components with the 
    spine db editor. To use the Load template block, drag it to the view and connect 
    it to the input database. Just like the Run SpineOpt block we need to drag the 
    available input database to the tool argument.

The result should look similar to this (+/- the Load template block):

That is it for the workflow. Now we can enter the data for the setup of the simple system 
into the input database, run the workflow and view the results in the output database.

### Entering input data

#### Importing the SpineOpt database template

-   Download [the SpineOpt database
    template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spine-tools/SpineOpt.jl/master/templates/spineopt_template.json)
    and [the basic SpineOpt
    model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spine-tools/SpineOpt.jl/master/templates/models/basic_model_template.json)
    (right click on the links, then select *Save link as...*)

-   Double click the input Data Store item 
    (or select the 'input' Data Store item in the *Design View*, 
    go to *Data Store Properties* and hit **Open editor**). 
    This will open the newly created database in the *Spine DB editor*,
     looking similar to this:
![image](figs_simple_system/simple_system_toolbox_empty.png)

!!! note
    The *Spine DB editor* is a dedicated interface within Spine Toolbox
    for visualizing and managing Spine databases. The default view shows 
    tables but for viewing energy system configurations it is nice to see 
    a graph. Open the hamburger menu (or press *Alt + F*) and press the 
    graph button. The graph view only shows what you select in the root menu 
    and what your selected objects or relationships are connected to.

-   To import the templates to the database, click the hamburger menu (or press **Alt + F**), 
    select **File -> Import...**, and then select the template file you previously
    downloaded (*spineopt\_template.json*). The contents of that file will be 
    imported into the current database, and you should then see classes like 
    'commodity', 'connection' and 'model' under the root node in the *Object tree*
     (on the left). Then import the second file (*basic\_model\_template.json*).

-   To save our changes, go again to the hamburger menu and select **Session -> Commit**.
    Enter a commit message, e.g. 'Import SpineOpt template', in the popup dialog
    and click **Commit**.

!!! note
    The SpineOpt template contains the fundamental entity classes
    and parameter definitions that SpineOpt recognizes and expects.
    The SpineOpt basic model template contains some predefined entities 
    for a common deterministic model with a 'flat' temporal structure.

#### Creating objects

-   Always in the Spine DB editor, locate the *Object tree* (typically
    at the top-left). Expand the [root] element if not
    expanded.

-   Right click on the [node] class, and select *Add objects* 
    from the context menu. The *Add objects* dialog will pop up.

-   Enter the names for the system nodes as seen in the image below,
    then press *Ok*. This will create two objects of class
    *node*, called *fuel\_node* and *electricity\_node*.
![image](figs_simple_system/simple_system_add_nodes.png)

-   Right click on the *unit* class, and select *Add
    objects* from the context menu. The *Add objects* dialog will pop
    up.

!!! note
    In SpineOpt, nodes are points where an energy balance takes place,
    whereas units are energy conversion devices that can take energy from
    nodes, and release energy to nodes.

-   Enter the names for the system units as seen in the image below,
    then press *Ok*. This will create two objects of class
    *unit*, called *power\_plant\_a* and
    *power\_plant\_b*.
![image](figs_simple_system/simple_system_add_units.png)

!!! note
    To modify an object after you enter it, right click on it and select
    **Edit...** from the context menu.

#### Establishing relationships

-   Always in the Spine DB editor, locate the *Relationship tree*
    (typically at the bottom-left). Expand the *root*
    element if not expanded.

-   Right click on the *unit\_\_from\_node* class, and select
    *Add relationships* from the context menu. The *Add relationships*
    dialog will pop up.

!!! note
    Alternatively right click the objects in the graph view and 
    *add relationships* will show the available relationships.
    Note that this only works when the involved units/nodes/... are visible
    in the graph view. To make an object visible, simply click on the object
    in the list of objects/object classes. You can select multiple objects with
    ctrl or shift.

-   Select the names of the two units and their **sending** nodes, as
    seen in the image below; then press *Ok*. This will establish that
    both *power\_plant\_a* and *power\_plant\_b*
    take energy from the *fuel\_node*.
![image](figs_simple_system/simple_system_add_unit__from_node_relationships.png)

-   Right click on the *unit\_\_to_node* class, and select
    *Add relationships* from the context menu. The *Add relationships*
    dialog will pop up.

-   Select the names of the two units and their **receiving** nodes, as
    seen in the image below; then press *Ok*. This will establish that
    both *power\_plant\_a* and *power\_plant\_b*
    release energy into the *electricity\_node*.
![image](figs_simple_system/simple_system_add_unit__to_node_relationships.png)

-   Right click on the *unit\_\_node\_\_node* class, and select
    *Add relationships* from the context menu. The *Add relationships*
    dialog will pop up.

-   For each of the units enter the unit under *unit*,
    *electricity_node* under the first node and *fuel_node* under the 
    second node. These relationships will define the relation (or behavior)
     between the output and input of the unit.
![image](figs_simple_system/simple_system_add_unit__node__node.png)

!!! note
    The *unit\_\_node\_\_node* relationship is necessary to limit the flow 
    (flows are unbound by default) and to define an efficiency.
    The order of the nodes is important for that definition (see later on).
    It may seem unintuitive to define an efficiency through a three-way 
    relationship instead of a property of a unit, but this approach allows you
    to define efficiencies between any flow(s) coming in and out of the unit (e.g. CHP). 

-   Right click on the *report\_\_output* class, and select
    *Add relationships* from the context menu. The *Add relationships*
    dialog will pop up.

-   Enter *report1* under *report*, and
    *unit\_flow* under *output*, as seen in the image below;
    then press *Ok*. This will tell SpineOpt to write the value of the
    *unit\_flow* optimization variable to the output
    database, as part of *report1*.
![image](figs_simple_system/simple_system_add_report__output_relationships.png)

!!! note
    In SpineOpt, outputs represent optimization variables that can be
    written to the output database as part of a report.

#### Specifying object parameter values

-   Back to *Object tree*, expand the *node* class and
    select *electricity\_node*.

-   Locate the *Object parameter* table (typically at the top-center).

-   In the *Object parameter* table (typically at the top-center),
    select the *demand* parameter and the *Base*
    alternative, and enter the value *150* as seen in the
    image below. This will establish that there's a demand of '150'
    at the electricity node.
![image](figs_simple_system/simple_system_electricity_demand.png)

!!! note
    The alternative name is not optional. If you don't select *Base* 
    (or another name) you will not be able to save your data.
    Speaking of which, when is the last time you saved/committed?

-   Select *fuel\_node* in the *Object tree*.

-   In the *Object parameter* table, select the
    *balance\_type* parameter and the *Base*
    alternative, and enter the value *balance\_type\_none* as
    seen in the image below. This will establish that the fuel node is
    not balanced, and thus provide as much fuel as needed.
![image](figs_simple_system/simple_system_fuel_balance_type.png)

#### Specifying relationship parameter values 

-   In *Relationship tree*, expand the *unit\_\_from\_node*
    class and select *power\_plant\_a | fuel\_node*.

-   In the *Relationship parameter* table (typically at the
    bottom-center), select the *vom\_cost* parameter and the
    *Base* alternative, and enter the value *25*
    as seen in the image below. This will set the operating cost for
    *power\_plant\_a*.
![image](figs_simple_system/simple_system_power_plant_a_vom_cost.png)

-   Select *power\_plant\_b | fuel\_node* in the *Relationship
    tree*.

-   In the *Relationship parameter* table, select the
    *vom\_cost* parameter and the *Base*
    alternative, and enter the value *50* as seen in the
    image below. This will set the operating cost for
    *power\_plant\_b*.
![image](figs_simple_system/simple_system_power_plant_b_vom_cost.png)

-   In *Relationship tree*, expand the *unit\_\_to_node*
    class and select *power\_plant\_a | electricity\_node*.

-   In the *Relationship parameter* table, select the
    *unit\_capacity* parameter and the *Base*
    alternative, and enter the value *100* as seen in the
    image below. This will set the capacity for
    *power\_plant\_a*.
![image](figs_simple_system/simple_system_power_plant_a_capacity.png)

-   Select *power\_plant\_b | electricity\_node* in the
    *Relationship tree*.

-   In the *Relationship parameter* table, select the
    *unit\_capacity* parameter and the *Base*
    alternative, and enter the value *200* as seen in the
    image below. This will set the capacity for
    *power\_plant\_b*.
![image](figs_simple_system/simple_system_power_plant_b_capacity.png)

-   In *Relationship tree*, select the
    *unit\_\_node\_\_node* class, and come back to the
    *Relationship parameter* table.

-   In the *Relationship parameter* table, select *power\_plant\_a |
    electricity\_node | fuel\_node* under *object name list*,
    *fix\_ratio\_out\_in\_unit\_flow* under *parameter name*,
    *Base* under *alternative name*, and enter
    *0.7* under *value*. Repeat the operation for
    *power\_plant\_b*, but this time enter *0.8*
    under *value*. This will set the conversion ratio from fuel to
    electricity for *power\_plant\_a* and
    *power\_plant\_b* to *0.7* and
    *0.8*, respectively. It should look like the image below.
![image](figs_simple_system/simple_system_fix_ratio_out_in_unit_flow.png)

!!! note
    The order of the nodes is important for the *fix\_ratio\_out\_in\_unit\_flow* 
    parameter. If you have swapped the nodes or inverted the efficiency values, 
    the Run SpineOpt tool will run into errors.

When you're ready, save/commit all changes to the database.

### Executing the workflow

-   Go back to Spine Toolbox's main window, and hit the **Execute
    project** button ![image](figs_simple_system/play-circle.png) from the tool bar. 
    You should see 'Executing All Directed Acyclic Graphs' printed in
    the *Event log* (at the bottom left by default).

-   Select the 'Run SpineOpt' Tool. You should see the output from
    SpineOpt in the *Julia Console* after clicking the *object activity control*.

### Examining the results

-   Select the output data store and open the Spine DB editor.
    You can already inspect the fields in the displayed tables 
    or use a pivot table.
-   For the pivot table, press **Alt + F** for the shortcut to the hamburger menu,
    and select **Pivot -> Index**.
-   Select
    *report\_\_unit\_\_node\_\_direction\_\_stochastic\_scenario*
    under **Relationship tree**, and the first cell under
    **alternative** in the *Frozen table*.
-   Under alternative in the Frozen table, you can choose results from
    different runs. Pick the run you want to view. If the workflow has
    been run several times, the most recent run will usually be found at
    the bottom.
-   The *Pivot table* will be populated with results from the SpineOpt
    run. It will look something like the image below.
